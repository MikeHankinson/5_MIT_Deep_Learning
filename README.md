Recognizing house number digits from street view images using Neural Networks. Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks



## Project
Recognizing house number digits from street view images using Neural Networks.

### Skills and Tools
Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks

### Context
One of the most interesting tasks in deep learning is to recognize objects in natural scenes. The ability to process visual information using machine learning algorithms can be very useful as demonstrated in various applications.

The SVHN dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos. It is one of the most popular image recognition datasets. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to improve map quality by automatically transcribing the address numbers from a patch of pixels. The transcribed number with a known street address helps pinpoint the location of the building it represents.

### Problem Statement
Build an Artificial Neural Network and an Convolutional Neural Network model that can identify the digits in the images.


### Results
All exploratory and inferential statistical analysis, visualization and clustering results are included in the following project notebooks:
